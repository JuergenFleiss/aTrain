- question: "How long does it take for the transcription to finish?"
  answer: "This depends on the hardware you use and also the model you selected. Our internal benchmarks showed that aTrain might need up to 4 times the audio duration
    when run on the largest models and on slow computers."

- question: "Is there a way to speed up the transcription?"
  answer: "aTrain can be run on a CPU (central processing unit) of a computer and also on a CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU (graphics processing unit). If you want to speed up your 
  transcriptions consider investing in a computer with a CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU. That should significantly speed up transcription times. For a list of CUDA-enabled GPUs see 
  https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus"

- question: "What is the difference between the various transcription models?"
  answer: "aTrain utilizes transcription models developed by OpenAI. These models vary in size, with larger models typically offering better performance but requiring more processing time. 
  Additionally, some models are optimized for specific languages, decreasing the processing time for those languages."

- question: "Which audio/video formats can I use?"
  answer: "aTrain uses the media processing tool ffmpeg in the background. All formats that can be handled by ffmpeg can also be handled by aTrain. For more information
    visit www.ffmpeg.org"

- question: "Do I have to specify the language of my audio file?"
  answer: "aTrain offers the possibility to automatically detect the language used in your audio. Sometimes this detection detects the wrong language, especially
    when languages are very similar. If you want to be sure to use the right language you can specify it."

- question: "My language is not available, what can I do?"
  answer: "If your language is not listed in aTrain, unfortunately, it is not supported. aTrain relies on transcription models developed by OpenAI, which only support a 
  limited number of languages. Additionally, some of these models are optimized for specific languages, making it impossible to select a different language for transcription."

- question: "Can I translate the transcription results into a different language than the one in the audio?"
  answer: "aTrain can translate every transcription into English if you select English on audios in other languages. Translation in other languages is not supported."

- question: "Why does aTrain not always detect speakers correctly?"
  answer: "aTrain uses a speaker detection system that generally performs better, if the number of speakers is known. If you used the auto-detect option the results
    may suffer."

- question: "Can I get the transcription result in a different format?"
  answer: "As for now aTrain only exports a format that is compatible with widely used tools for qualitative research such as MAXQDA. If you need a different format
    you can use the json file from the output to construct your own. Feel free to contact the developers if you have suggestions for new output formats."

- question: "Does aTrain send data to the internet?"
  answer: "Generally aTrain does not send anything to the internet since all models run offline. Atrain has some models pre-installed and users can download additional models
  from Hugging Face in the included model manager."

- question: "Where does aTrain store my transcriptions and downloaded models?"
  answer: "aTrain saves your past transcriptions and downloaded models in the 'aTrain' folder, located within your system's Documents directory."
